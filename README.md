# WordPress template for Flexible Web Publisher (FWP) on Platform.sh

This project provides a starter kit for WordPress projects hosted on by Flexible Web Publisher on Platform.sh. It is primarily an example, although could be used as the starting point for a real project.  It is built using Composer, via the popular <a href="https://github.com/johnpbloch/wordpress">johnpbloch/wordpress</a> script.

This template has been consciously build to allow FWP users not to worry about ssh setup to deploy their application and manage it from their Wordpress backend only.
